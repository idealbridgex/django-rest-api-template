# SIMPLE CRUD API WITH DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
[Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Django 3.1
- Django REST Framework

## Installation
After you cloned the repository, you want to create a virtual environment, so you have a clean python installation.
You can do this by running the command
```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```


After this, it is necessary to activate the virtual environment, you can get more information about this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

You can install all the required dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure
In a RESTful API, endpoints (URLs) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints should be logically organized around _collections_ and _elements_, both of which are resources.

In our case, we have one single resource, `test`

Endpoint |HTTP Method | CRUD Method | Result
-- | -- |-- |--
`test` | GET | READ | Get 
`test`| POST 

## Use
We can test the API using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie#installation), or we can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

Httpie is a user-friendly http client that's written in Python. Let's try and install that.

You can install httpie using pip:
```
pip install httpie
```

First, we have to start up Django's development server.
```
python manage.py runserver
```
```

```
